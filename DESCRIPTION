Title: Utilities for common WSP visualizations
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Arttu Kosonen
Maintainer: Arttu Kosonen <arttu.kosonen@wsp.com>
Description: This package currently includes color palette functions
  by which one can avoid repeatedly looking for hex codes of
  commonly used colors. In future, I plan to provide
  other utilities as well such as WSP-styled ggplot2 themes.
